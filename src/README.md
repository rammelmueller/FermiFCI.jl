## Core functionality
The core functionality itself should not be altered by the user. This explanation simply provides some insights into the inner workings of the package and what datatypes are available.

### Representation of states

### Construction of the Hamiltonian

### Diagonalization

## Utils
These are various functions that are not strictly speaking in the core functionality of FermiFCI. Examples include the comuptation of the one-body density matrix, density profiles and construction functions for the many body basis. Those are found in `utils/`.
